# Marlborough Jazz Platform

The Marlborough Jazz Platform is a monthly live event where jazz musicians come to perform with the house band. Itâ€™s a night that is suited to both players and audience members. Each month new songs will be performed so the event needs a home online where people can find out more information. That is the purpose of this site.

    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - YouTube


![Footer with social links](assets/images/footer.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)
#### House Band
- The House Band page has a small bio at the top of the page introducing the band as a whole, this should build anticipation and excitement and encourage the viewer to read the individual bios of the members of the house band including:
    - Miles Davis: Trumpet
    - Django Reinhardt: Guitar
    - Herbie Hancock: Keys
    - Jaco Pastorious: Bass
    - Steve Gadd: Drums
- On a desktop and laptop this page will alternate between the image of the band member being on the left and the bio on the right to the image being on the left and the bio on the right. But, for smaller screen sizes all the information will stack to make it easier to read.
- The band members names are clickable links to their official webites or wikipedia pages that have an underline affect when hovered over. This is to build continuity between the navigation section of the site and the other clickable links.

![Desktop view of the house band page](assets/images/house-band-dm.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)
#### Contact Form
- To open up communication with people interested in coming to one of the events there is a contact form asking:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Email Address
    - Message
    - Instrument
    - Song Request
- The Name, email, message and instrument sections are mandatory but the song request isn't as not everyone sending a message will have a song request.
- The styling of the form is in keeping with the rest of the site to keep excitememt up and encourage attendance at the live event.

![Contact Form](assets/images/contact-form.png)

#### Contact Form Sucess Page

### Accesibility

While designing and coding the site I have tried to be as conscious about the usability of the site for users of all types, including anyone using screen readers. This includes:
- Using semantic HTML
- Adding alt or aria attributes on images and logos for screen readers
- Ensuring there is good contrast between the background images/colors and the foreground text
- Making the menus accessible and indicating what page the site in currently displaying.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
The following bugs were encountered during the build of the site:
- To get the navigation menu to stick to the left and right sides of the page I needed to put the page title and the links to the other pages in their own flexboxes.
- When using flexbox inside flexbox I had to experiment with using the correct alignment: `justify-content` or `align-items`.
- The contact form was not filling the whole screen, there was a white space at the bottom of the page, tis was fixed by adding a min-height of 80vp to the form-section div.
- The hero-image was too big and caused the load time to be slow so I replaced it with a smaller version.
- The background image for the contact form was not in the position I wanted so I used the `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center;` to get it where I wanted.
- There was a white space to the right-hand side of the screen on mobile devices that was caused by the navigation flexbox section ovreflowing. I fixed this by adding `max-width: 100vw;` and reducing the padding inside a `@media` query.
- The comment box in the contact form was not transparent, this was fixed by targeting the textarea property in the CSS.
- The hover on the house band members names wasn't working. This was fixed by add in spesificty to the `:hover` CSS rule by using an `id` instead of a `class`.
- The `H1` on the navigation menu was too big for mobile devices, I used a `@media` query to reduce it for smaller screens.
- Once the contact form had been filled out it was not sending you to the success.html page. This was fixed by removing the method tag and setting the action tag to `success.html`.
- Hero image was displaying a non-sensical section for mobile devices so I moved the position.
- On a tablet the next event and join-us sections had lot's of unused space so I added an extra media query for smaller screens.
- Added a title to the map's iframe to increase lighthouse score.
